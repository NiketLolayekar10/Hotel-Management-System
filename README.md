  # Hotel Management System

  This is a code bundle for Hotel Management System. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/nPuX0gTTJk3tp5EaRpSxBK/Hotel-Management-System.

  ## Running the code (development)

  1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  2. Create a Supabase project (recommended) and set the following environment variables in a `.env.local` file at the project root:

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # used only for deploying the server functions
    ```

    Note: The client uses the anon key. Keep your `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` private.

  3. Start the dev server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  4. Build for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run preview
    ```

  ## Supabase setup (short)
  - Create a Postgres table `kv_store_3e6b123f` with columns `key TEXT PRIMARY KEY` and `value JSONB` (see `src/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.tsx` for schema).
  - Deploy the server functions in `src/supabase/functions/server` as Supabase Edge Functions or run them with the Supabase/Deno environment.
  - The app will call functions under the prefix `/make-server-3e6b123f/*` to initialize data, create admin, perform bookings, etc.

  ## Notes
  - This project previously included an autogenerated `info.tsx` with a project id and anon key. For security and flexibility, please use environment variables as shown above and do not commit service role keys.
  - If you want, I can help automate the function deployment and add a script to check the required Supabase resources exist.
